# Zodiac Clock

This is a zodiac clock I made with p5.js. The easiest way to see it in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](concentric-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

To read the clock's time, you must use the number decoding table below to determine the number that matches the zodiac symbol on the clock. To read the minutes passed 12, take the number from the first sign and combine it with the number from the secondsign. Ex: Cancer : Leo Libra = 4:57.

The concepts demonstrated in the code rely on some of the examples shared by Golan Levin in the instructions for his class's [clock assignment](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/tree/master/lecture_clock). The look of the clock is meant to highlight the mystical and celestial qualities associated with astrology, numerology, and zodiacs. 

I have a strong interest in astrology, as it is part of my family's culture. Because of this, I thought it would be interesting to use my knowledge of astrology and numerology to create a simple clock. It is something unique that I have not seen before in any iterations of clocks or telling time.
