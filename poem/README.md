# Ovid Poem

This project is a poem generator in Python. To run the code, you must download the ovidpoem.py file and download markovify.

What this script will do is read the input file, and then run it through a markov chain. From there, it will print 4 short lines of randomized poetry with each line being 60 characters or less.  

I chose to use a markov chain in my code because I want to try something different than I had done last time I did a project like this. I thought that a Markov chain would be the best way to create a random poem that still might make some sense. 

I personally think that my code has produced some unique an beautiful poems with my chosen text of the 10th book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. To me some of the best poems are brief with beautiful language, and my code produces poems that reflect that. I think that choosing to use a Markov chain definetely helped create my vision for a great poem generator.
