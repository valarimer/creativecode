# Bot Project

This bot, [@dailysimlish](https://twitter.com/DailySimlish), is meant to create and share unique sentences in the language of EA's the Sims, Simlish. This bot uses over 100 different Simlish words and phrases to create these sentences. This was my first idea that came to mind when thinking about this project. I have been playing the Sims since I was very young, and I always thought the Simlish language was interesting. This bot can create 2,951,910 unique combinations. 

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
