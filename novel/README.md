# Harry Potter and the Markov Chain

This python program is designed to generate a novel of 50,000 words or more through the use of multiple Markov chains. 
The program takes seven input files, creates a markov chain for each file, and then combines them all into one text model with an equal chance ratio. From here, it saves the output into a pdf file based on the HTML template. 

My idea for this program was to create a new Harry Potter novel by taking all seven existing novels and running them through my program. All seven of the Harry Potter novels can be found as .txt files in the novel directory.
As someone who has always enjoyed Harry Potter, I thought that this would be a creative way to continue the story and potentially make something interesting. While the program's intended use is to create a new Harry Potter novel using the previous seven, it can be used for any other novel generations, provided that seven input files are used.
