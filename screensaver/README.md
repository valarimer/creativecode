# Halloween Screen

This project is a "screensaver" designed for the media wall in the HCC. The theme of my screensaver is Halloween. Halloween is my favorite holiday, and with it coming up this month, I decided to make a cute screensaver for it. I used 4 main images for this screensaver, all of which are included in this folder. The first image is the background, which is an 8-bit style cemetery. The next three images are gifs of a cartoon bat, ghost, and cat. The screensaver is designed to generate a bat, a ghost, a cat, and a witch going moving across the screen in different locations and then looping back to the beginning once it hits the edge. The screensaver also generates a stationary bouncing pumpkin. Through much trial and error, I was able to get the witch to seemingly chase the cat by changing the spawn locations. 

For version I'm sharing here, run it by copying the javascript [source code](halloweenscreen.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org). 

The inspiration for this project is the [Fish screensaver](https://www.bryanbraun.com/after-dark-css/all/fish.html) from Bryan Braun.
